[13:02:23] [WARNING] you've provided target URL without any GET parameters (e.g. 'http://www.site.com/article.php?id=1') and without providing any POST parameters through option '--data'
do you want to try URI injections in the target URL itself? [Y/n/q] Y
[13:02:23] [INFO] testing connection to the target URL
[13:02:53] [CRITICAL] connection timed out to the target URL. sqlmap is going to retry the request(s)
[13:02:53] [WARNING] if the problem persists please check that the provided target URL is reachable. In case that it is, you can try to rerun with switch '--random-agent' and/or proxy switches ('--proxy', '--proxy-file'...)
[13:03:30] [CRITICAL] previous heuristics detected that the target is protected by some kind of WAF/IPS
[13:03:30] [INFO] testing if the target URL content is stable
[13:03:30] [WARNING] target URL content is not stable (i.e. content differs). sqlmap will base the page comparison on a sequence matcher. If no dynamic nor injectable parameters are detected, or in case of junk results, refer to user's manual paragraph 'Page comparison'
how do you want to proceed? [(C)ontinue/(s)tring/(r)egex/(q)uit] C
[13:03:30] [CRITICAL] can't check dynamic content because of lack of page content
[13:03:30] [INFO] testing if URI parameter '#1*' is dynamic
[13:03:31] [WARNING] URI parameter '#1*' does not appear to be dynamic
[13:03:31] [WARNING] heuristic (basic) test shows that URI parameter '#1*' might not be injectable
[13:03:31] [INFO] testing for SQL injection on URI parameter '#1*'
[13:03:31] [INFO] testing 'AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause'
[13:03:32] [INFO] testing 'Boolean-based blind - Parameter replace (original value)'
[13:03:32] [INFO] testing 'MySQL >= 5.1 AND error-based - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause (EXTRACTVALUE)'
[13:03:33] [INFO] testing 'PostgreSQL AND error-based - WHERE or HAVING clause'

[13:03:38] [INFO] testing 'Oracle AND time-based blind'
it is recommended to perform only basic UNION tests if there is not at least one other (potential) technique found. Do you want to reduce the number of requests? [Y/n] Y
[13:03:38] [INFO] testing 'Generic UNION query (NULL) - 1 to 10 columns'
[13:03:39] [WARNING] URI parameter '#1*' does not seem to be injectable
[13:03:39] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Try to increase values for '--level'/'--risk' options if you wish to perform more tests. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment') and/or switch '--random-agent'
[13:03:39] [WARNING] HTTP error codes detected during run:
